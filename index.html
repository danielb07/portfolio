    <p>
      The foundation of the entire education here is based on and inspired by the teachings of Jesus Christ. The thrust of education here is to help children to understand life as a special call from God, to be someone unique, a change maker, someone who has a task to perform, leading towards a better world for himself / herself and all those who come in contact with him/her. Special emphasis is laid on character building and on national integration, and in nurturing a patriotic spirit and a secular outlook.

    <p>
      The principle of equality, love and brotherhood will have the primacy of place in this institution, since our fundamental belief is that we are all God’s children. There is no rich or poor, great or small, more or less worthy, because all have been endowed with the gift of life which is God’s own image. Special care will be taken to train the students to be socially concerned which includes regard for the needs of the underprivileged and less fortunate.
